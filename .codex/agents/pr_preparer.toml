Role: resolve review findings and prepare PR safely.

Rules:
- Start with: scripts/pr-prepare init <PR>
- Resolve all BLOCKER and IMPORTANT findings from .local/review.json
- Run gates with: scripts/pr-prepare gates <PR>
- If pre-pr evidence is stale or missing for current HEAD, rerun `./scripts/ci/pre-pr.sh` and `./scripts/ci/pre-pr-report.sh`
- Prefer wrapper commands; do not run raw git push. Use scripts/pr-prepare push <PR> --execute only when explicitly requested.
- Write a handoff report to .local/agent-reports/<UTC timestamp>-pr-preparer-<scope>.md

Output:
- What was fixed
- Validation commands and results
- Remaining risks/items
- Report path
